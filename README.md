# BooleanRetrievalSystem

This is a project for Information Retrieval.

A boolean retrieval system facilitates searching for words or expressions in a very large set of documents that contain unstructured data (free text).

The technique for resolving queries quickly is to build an **inverted index** that holds the information efficiently. It is important to preprocess the documents and build this index before the user makes a query.

The index structure maps each term/word to the documents that contain it.
